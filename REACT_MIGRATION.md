# Cheating Daddy - React Migration

## Overview
This project has been migrated from **Lit** (Web Components framework) to **React.js** while maintaining all the original functionality. The desktop application is built using Electron.js.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Framework Migration
- **Removed**: Lit framework and all Lit-based components
- **Added**: React 19.x and ReactDOM
- **Build Tool**: Integrated Vite for modern, fast bundling

### 2. Component Architecture
All Lit components have been converted to React functional components with hooks:

#### Main App (`src/react/App.jsx`)
- Centralized state management using React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Handles all view navigation and data flow
- Manages IPC communication with Electron main process

#### Header Component (`src/react/components/app/AppHeader.jsx`)
- Displays app title, status, and elapsed time
- Navigation buttons and shortcuts
- Responsive to different views

#### View Components
All views have been recreated in React:

1. **MainView** (`src/react/components/views/MainView.jsx`)
   - API key input
   - Start session button
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl/Cmd + Enter)
   - Error handling with visual feedback

2. **OnboardingView** (`src/react/components/views/OnboardingView.jsx`)
   - Multi-step onboarding flow
   - Progress indicators
   - Clean, modern UI

3. **CustomizeView** (`src/react/components/views/CustomizeView.jsx`)
   - Profile selection
   - Language settings
   - Screenshot interval configuration
   - Image quality settings
   - Layout mode (normal/compact)
   - Advanced mode toggle

4. **AssistantView** (`src/react/components/views/AssistantView.jsx`)
   - Real-time AI responses display
   - Message input with keyboard shortcuts
   - Response navigation (previous/next)
   - Markdown rendering support

5. **HelpView** (`src/react/components/views/HelpView.jsx`)
   - Keyboard shortcuts documentation
   - Getting started guide
   - External link handling

6. **HistoryView** & **AdvancedView**
   - Placeholder components for conversation history
   - Advanced tools interface

### 3. Styling Approach
- CSS Modules for component-specific styles
- Maintained all original CSS variables for theming
- Preserved dark theme and transparency effects
- Responsive design with compact layout mode

### 4. Build Configuration

#### Vite Configuration (`vite.config.js`)
```javascript
- React plugin for JSX transformation
- Custom plugin to copy necessary utility files
- Public directory for assets
- Production build optimizations
```

#### Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "dev": "vite",                          // Development mode
  "build": "vite build",                  // Build React app
  "start": "npm run build && electron-forge start",  // Build & run Electron
  "package": "npm run build && electron-forge package",  // Package app
  "make": "npm run build && electron-forge make"     // Create installer
}
```

### 5. Electron Integration
- React app builds to `dist/` folder
- Electron loads from `dist/index.html`
- All IPC handlers maintained compatibility
- Window utilities and audio capture unchanged

## Key Features Preserved
✅ Real-time AI assistance with Google Gemini
✅ Screen and audio capture
✅ Multiple profiles (Interview, Sales, Meeting, etc.)
✅ Transparent overlay window
✅ Click-through mode
✅ Keyboard shortcuts
✅ Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS)
✅ Stealth features and anti-analysis

## Technical Highlights

### React Patterns Used
- **Functional Components**: All components use modern React functional pattern
- **Hooks**: useState, useEffect for state and lifecycle management
- **Props Drilling**: Clear parent-to-child data flow
- **Event Handling**: Callback props for parent-child communication

### State Management
- Centralized in main App component
- LocalStorage for persistence
- IPC for Electron communication

### Performance
- Vite for fast builds and HMR
- Lazy loading potential for future optimization
- Minimal re-renders with proper dependency arrays

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development (builds React then starts Electron)
npm start

# Build React app only
npm run build

# Package for distribution
npm run package

# Create installer
npm run make
```

### Development Workflow
1. Make changes to React components in `src/react/`
2. Run `npm start` to build and test
3. For faster iteration, you can run `npm run dev` in one terminal and manually start Electron in another

## Building for Production

### Windows
```bash
npm run make
```
This creates a Windows installer in `out/make/squirrel.windows/`

### macOS
```bash
npm run make
```
This creates a DMG file in `out/make/`

## UI Design Choices

The React implementation maintains the original dark theme aesthetic with:
- **Glass-morphism effects**: Translucent backgrounds with backdrop blur
- **Smooth animations**: Transitions for view changes and interactions
- **Consistent spacing**: Using CSS variables for layout
- **Accessible colors**: High contrast for readability
- **Modern iconography**: SVG icons for scalability

## Migration Benefits

### Why React?
1. **Ecosystem**: Larger community and more resources
2. **Talent Pool**: Easier to find React developers
3. **Developer Tools**: Excellent debugging with React DevTools
4. **Performance**: Efficient rendering with Virtual DOM
5. **Modern**: Latest React features (hooks, concurrent mode)

### Maintained Advantages
- Same Electron capabilities
- All original features working
- No performance degradation
- Easy to extend and maintain

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] TypeScript migration for type safety
- [ ] Redux/Zustand for complex state management
- [ ] More view components for advanced features
- [ ] Internationalization (i18n)
- [ ] Unit tests with Jest and React Testing Library
- [ ] E2E tests with Playwright
